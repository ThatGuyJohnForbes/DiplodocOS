# DiplodocOS
Learning the intricacies of the GNU/Linux kernel by attempting to make a deliberately vulnerable kernel that hopefully one day will have the same APIs as the GNU/Linux kernel, and as such could run a Linux distro over it.

# Development on this repo has stopped temporaily
While working on this I realised that my required knowledge of this topic was lacking, as such I am taking time away from this project to learn more about linux and kernels in general, as well as the intricacies of os development.

As a first step towards this I am working on a Linux From Scratch build.
